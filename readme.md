# Quantum-Secure Adaptive Hybrid Encryption (QSAHE) with Immutable NFTs

Welcome to the Quantum-Secure Adaptive Hybrid Encryption (QSAHE) project repository! This project showcases an advanced implementation that combines the QSAHE encryption method, steganography, and immutable NFTs. This approach enhances security, authenticity, and uniqueness of hidden information within NFTs.

## Overview

The Quantum-Secure Adaptive Hybrid Encryption (QSAHE) method presents a novel approach to encryption, combining the strengths of symmetric, asymmetric, and quantum-safe cryptographic techniques. This advanced implementation goes beyond encryption and explores embedding encrypted data within immutable NFTs using steganography. This ensures secure storage, ownership authenticity, and resilience against quantum threats.
