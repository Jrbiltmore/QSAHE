# Visual Steganography: Embedding Encryption Methods and Codes in Graphics Files

This repository demonstrates a method of embedding encryption methods, codes, and decryption protocols into a graphics file using visual steganography. The goal is to hide sensitive information imperceptibly within the carrier image.

## Method Overview

### 1. Select a Carrier Image

Choose a suitable graphics file (JPEG, PNG, etc.) as the carrier image. Ensure the image can accommodate the hidden data without compromising its quality.

### 2. Prepare Hidden Data

Gather the encryption methods, codes, and decryption protocols you want to hide. Convert this data into a binary format suitable for embedding.

### 3. LSB Embedding Strategy

Use the Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding technique to hide the binary data within the carrier image. Replace the least significant bit of pixel color values with bits from the hidden data.

### 4. Embed Hidden Data

1. Break the binary hidden data into smaller chunks.
2. For each pixel in the carrier image, replace the least significant bit of a color component with a bit from the hidden data.
3. Repeat this process until all hidden data is embedded.

### 5. Save Modified Graphics File

Save the modified graphics file containing the embedded hidden data. Ensure the file format and image quality remain close to the original.

### 6. Extraction and Decryption

1. Load the modified carrier image.
2. Extract the least significant bit from the color component of each pixel.
3. Reconstruct the binary hidden data by assembling the extracted bits.
4. Apply decryption protocols to retrieve the original encryption methods and codes.

### 7. Considerations

- Choose carrier images of appropriate sizes.
- Modify least significant bits cautiously to avoid artifacts.
- Encrypt hidden data before embedding.
- Add noise or variations to further disguise the hidden data.

### 8. Testing and Optimization

Test the steganographic process with different images and hidden data to find the optimal balance between capacity and imperceptibility.

## Example Implementation

The `steganography.py` script in this repository provides a simple Python implementation of the described steganography process. Use it as a starting point to experiment with embedding and extracting hidden data.

## Disclaimer

Steganography is a technique with potential legal and ethical implications. Ensure you understand the legal context and intended usage before implementing or using steganography methods.
